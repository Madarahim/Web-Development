This file contains a personal website I developed. It offers one of my greatest personal interests, Jeep Safaries across California.
It was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It contains a payment button from Paypal.com in order to purchase certain Safari
packages. I also provides descriptions of the Parks, a place to contact the company, and links to other appropriate websites so
people can get inpsired from the beauty of California's Nature and Wildlife.
